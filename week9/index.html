  <h2>Week 9 notes</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>Global object in a browser is the window object.</li>
    <li>Global variables can be initiated without let or var, and then are access like "varName" or "window.varName".</li>
    <li>Don't use dialogs unless absolutely necessary - they are aggravating for the user, and aren't reliable.</li>
    <li>window.history.go(int) allows you to access browser history by navigating a specific number of pages forward or backward.</li>
    <li>Why is document.write() frowned upon?</li>
    <li>The data- attribute allows us to store custom private data in the page.</li>
    <li>localStorage is part of Web Storage API. It allows storing data, like cookies, but there isn't a data limit and the data isn't shared with the server for each request.</li>
    <li>The navigator object of Geolocation API can be used to get geographical location with the getCurrentPosition() method.</li>
    <li>They probably use navigator or something similar for Google Maps? The position object of the getCurrentPosition() method has properties like speed, altitude, heading, etc.</li>
    <li>workers allow for multitasking or concurrency.</li>
    <li>The websocket protocol allows for push messaging - useful for chat programs, as the server can "push" replies to the client.</li>
    <li>Media API allows for management of multimedia content in a webpage.</li>
    <li>How was the battery API used for user profiling?</li>
  </ul>
