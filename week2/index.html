  <h1>Dallin's Portfolio</h1>
  <h2>Week 2 notes</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>const is unchangeable, let is changeable variable (can be reassigned)</li>
    <li>Arrays are notated with regular brackets [] and can contain different types of objects</li>
    <li>Is it possible to make infinitely layered arrays of arrays? How many layers down does javascript allow us to go?</li>
    <li>Beware memory leaks</li>
    <li>For loops are considered cleaner than while loops</li>
    <li>Keep your code DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)</li>
    <li>Doesn't it get a little confusing trying to define a complex function with the arrow => notation? It seems like this is best for simpler functions, but maybe I'm wrong.</li>
  </ul>
