  <h2>Week 8 notes</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>Don't declare multiple transforms otherwise the later ones override the previous ones</li>
    <li>Order of transforms matters</li>
    <li>Animations can be created using keyframes</li>
    <li>Canvas width and height need to be specified in-line to override the default dimensions</li>
    <li>Are 3D graphics considered good practice for web pages? It seems like they would be more resource intensive.</li>
    <li>You can save a canvas drawing using the canvas toDataURL function</li>
    <li>SVG is somewhat easier to draw with than canvas.</li>
  </ul>
