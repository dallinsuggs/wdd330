  <h2>Week 10 notes</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>Data validation is important to avoid errors, as well as protect everyone's data from people with malicious intent.</li>
    <li>If server side validation is being implemented, is there any real security benefit to using client-side validation? Client-side validation can easily be turned off by the browser user anyway.</li>
    <li>I will note that client-side validation is definitely useful for updating the page with feedback real-time (showing the field red on invalid inputs even before hitting 'submit').</li>
    <li>Well, I got further in, and it looks like constraint validation API is the answer to the issue I proposed in my previous question.</li>
    <li>Fetch requests provide a simple alternative to jQuery.ajax() - fetch requests do work slightly differently as well.</li>
    <li>Fetch requests can both upload and request json data.</li>
    <li>Custom headers can be created for fetch requests using the Headers interface.</li>
  </ul>
