  <h2>Week 7 notes</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>IIFE functions are really useful for controlling scope.</li>
    <li>If you use strict mode, put all your code inside an IIFE function to avoid applying strict mode to anyone else's code you end up using.</li>
    <li>Recursive functions are powerful, but be careful (make sure the loop ends at some point!)</li>
    <li>AJAX fetch requests can receive responses in various formats, including HTML and json.</li>
    <li>To customize requests, we can create and provide a request object with its own properties.</li>
    <li>Any real reason to use a patch request over a put request? Just if the data item is really big? For small stuff it seems like patch wouldn't be worth the trouble.</li>
    <li>AJAX requests can not only request information to display on a web page, but also send data to update a database.</li>
  </ul>
