  <h1>Dallin's Portfolio</h1>
  <h2>Week 3 notes</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>Arrow notated functions ( => ) don't have a 'this'! I had no idea. That is another difference between arrow functions and regular ones.</li>
    <li>Object literals are great for OOP.</li>
    <li>I learned you can put javascript code in [] brackets as the property of a property key. I wonder, can you put a function inside those brackets to return a value?</li>
    <li>I was not aware of this bracket notation for calling functions! superman['fly']()</li>
    <li>You can access by tag name or class in javascript, besides using the default getelemendbyid.</li>
    <li>In DOM, the value of a node can be accessed like [node-name].firstChild</li>
    <li>Javascript can be used to dynamically add markup to a webpage (i.e. document.createElement())</li>
    <li>Are there any common situations where you would want to build most or all of a webpage's content from within JavaScript?</li>
    <li>Event listeners are the new standard, because they free up the program to worry about other things instead of requiring the program to constantly check something.</li>
    <li>Wouldn't it be considered bad practice to add a click event listener to a p element, since p does not semantically represent a button?</li>
  </ul>
