  <h1>Dallin's Portfolio</h1>
  <h2>Week 4 notes</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>Better not to include a reset button in forms.</li>
    <li>Why don't we use a button's "onClick" attribute for form submission?</li>
    <li>input type=password makes an input field for passwords (who knew) and hides what the user is typing.</li>
    <li>You can use keyUp to check for form errors real-time before submission - this is very user friendly.</li>
    <li>The static keyword is used in javascript class definitions to make a method only available to the class itself, and not to instances thereof.</li>
    <li>"default export"s make importing modularized functions or variables more streamlined in Javascript (doesn't require curly braces, for example).</li>
    <li>When adding properties or methods to the prototype of a class, it updates that same info for all instances of the class that were made before.</li>
    <li>What are prototypes useful for exactly? Just updating a class after initial definition/construction?</li>
    <li></li>
  </ul>
