  <h2>Week 5 notes</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>Putting the line 'use strict;' at the top of javascript files and functions enforces stricter error checking</li>
    <li>Linters can help check for bad practices and syntax errors, as well as enforce a styling guide to make sure everyone codes in the same way</li>
    <li>That being said, isn't it true that most linters "grade" code subjectively? I feel like whoever creates a linter will imbue it with their own ideal practices, not necessarily "required" ones</li>
    <li>alert() can be used like a built-in break point, since it displays information, and stops the rest of the program in the meantime (unlike console logging which doesn't stop the program)</li>
    <li>Browser consoles often let us set breakpoints for testing purposes within the browser itself</li>
    <li>TDD stands for Test-Driven Development</li>
  </ul>
